## Q1: Goal?

As a tech person, when I want to deliver yet another AI application or just a AI chat demo, I don't want to start from scratch. I will pickup a github project. And spent let say couple of hours and make it done.

First thing first. I would like to see how it works under the hood and how it connect to the AI model as expected.

- So there is a demo of whole story not only present how it looks, but also how it works
- So there is a website to present the demo, but the app should be standalone and reusable
- So there is an AI app standalone.
- So there is a monorepo hosts both website and standalone all together
