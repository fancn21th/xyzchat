## Q1: Goal ?

As a tech pre-sales guy, when I want to present yet another AI application or just a AI chat demo for our customers, I don't want to start from scratch. Picking-up a github project, evaluate and decide. At last couple of hours later the demo is done.

- So there is a demo of whole story not only present how it looks, but also how it works
- So there is a website to present the demo, but the app should be standalone and reusable
- So there is an AI app standalone.
- So there is a monorepo hosts both website and standalone all together

## Q2: Style ?

As a engineer, I ask myself where to start ? The UI or the State / Behavior ? What is the common sense to build a AI app ?
