# Q1: Goal ?

As a tech person, when I want to deliver yet another AI application or just a demo, I don't want to start from scratch. I will pickup a github project. And Give it a try. First thing first. I would like to see how it works under the hood and hot it connect to the AI model I already have.

- So there is a demo not only present how it looks like, but also how it works
- So there is a website to present the demo, but the app should be standalone and reusable
- So there is an ai app standalone.
- So there is a monorepo hosts both website and standalone all together
